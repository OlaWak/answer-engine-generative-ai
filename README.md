# CS3307 Practice Quiz 🌸

A soft pink-themed, password-protected quiz app built with React + Next.js for reviewing CS3307 content — inspired by [Ajay Dhangar's](https://github.com/Ajay-Dhangar) Morphic project.

This project was originally forked from [Ajay Dhangar's](https://github.com/Ajay-Dhangar/answer-engine-generative-ai) `answer-engine-generative-ai` repo and modified to create a completely new quiz app focused on CS3307 review. The original AI-powered features were replaced with a clean, quiz-based layout tailored for interactive studying.
